## *About Myself*

    Since my graduating Moscow State Technical University (Bauman MSTU) I have been working in the field of my diploma as an Engineer-Phisicist at JSC 'NIKIET'. I'm currently an reliability engineer and deal with probability analysis of different technical systems of nuclear power plants and related factory and technologies.

    I apply coding more and more in my daily work. I've discovered that it is very interesting for me, as I have a lot of statistics involved in my job. I grew interested in this sphere and now I want to find work related to coding and statistics. I don't know which sphere exactly I will choose for the next step, but I've decided to change my life.

    I'm patient and practice-oreinted, I enjoy to study new and interesting topics. Now I want to try something in IT, which led me to this course. I hope I would gain a lot of useful skills and find new ways for my professional development. I suppose that my diligence and curiosity would help me with this aim.

    In my daily life I prefer active lifestyle and sports: I've been swimming since six years old, I enjoy inline-skating, kayaking. I like play the guitar and reading. I love my cat. I recharge getting out in nature.

## *SKILLS*
* Git (GitHub)\
* R (including: dplyr, tidyr, stringr, ggplot2)
* Python 3 (basic)
* SQL (MySQL)
* Risk Spectrum (for Probability Safety Analysis)
* good knowledgs in statistics
** Microsoft Office :-)

## *Code example*
This is Kata 'Permutations' of 4 kyu for Python. The task is [here](<https://www.codewars.com/kata/5254ca2719453dcc0b00027d/python>)

```
def permutations(s):
    per = list()

    if len(s) == 1:
        return list(s)

    for i in ''.join(set(s)):

        for j in permutations(s.replace(i, '', 1)):
            per.append(i + j)

    return per
```
