## *About Myself*

Since my graduating Moscow State Technical University (Bauman MSTU) I have been working in my speciality 'Engineer-Phisicist' at JSC 'NIKIET'. Today I'm an reliability engineer and deal with probability analisys of different technical system of nuclear power plants and related factory and technologies.

In my daily working life I am coding more and more. And as I have a lot of statistics in my job I discovered, that it is very interesting for me. And the decision to find work related to coding and statistics was come to me. I don't know exacty what I want to do more, but I decided to change my life.

I like to study new and interesting. Now I want to try something in IT, so I'm on this course. I hope that could gain a lot of usefull skills and find new way for my development. I suppose that my diligence and curiosity would help me at this.

And in my daily life I am active enough, like any sports (swimming since six years old), inline-skating, kayaking. I like play the guitar and reading artistic literatures. I love my cat. And I love to be out in Nature.

## *SKILLS*

* Git (GitHub)
* R (including: dplyr, tidyr, stringr, ggplot2)
* Python 3 (basic)
* SQL (MySQL)
* Rick Spectrum (for Probability Safety Analysis)
* good knowledgs in statistics
* Microsoft Office :-) 

## *Code example*

This is Kata 'Permutations' of 4 kyu for Python.
The task is [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5254ca2719453dcc0b00027d/python)

```
def permutations(s):
    per = list()

    if len(s) == 1:
        return list(s)

    for i in ''.join(set(s)):

        for j in permutations(s.replace(i, '', 1)):
            per.append(i + j)

    return per
```
